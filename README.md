### About Me

I've been putting and keeping things on the Internet for 20 years, including
back-end game infrastructure on [various][fish] [platforms][ape] and an [IoT
platform][hive], amongst others.

The first software I ever released was Shareware for the ATARI ST. The first
job I ever had was writing IBM S/390 Assembler. Since then I've been through C,
Perl, Ruby. Today I mainly write Go.

I'm an SRE. I write software to automate the provisioning and maintenance of
Cloud Infrastructure. In general, that's the easy bit.
